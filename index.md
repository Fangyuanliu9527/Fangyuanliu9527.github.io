<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>


Currently, I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at Laboratory of Unmanned Intelligent Systems, [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), China, working under the mentorship of Prof. [Zhan Tu](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/tuzhan/zh_CN/index/174863/list/index.htm), Prof. [Daochun Li](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/lidaochun/en/index.htm), and Prof. [Jinwu Xiang (Academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering)](https://www.ase.buaa.edu.cn/info/1072/9854.htm). Before that, I got my B.S. from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My research concentrates on the development of a centimeter-scale, motor-driven flapping-wing robot, which is truly insect-like in terms of tailless and two-winged configurations, attitude control approach, and hovering flight capability. I carried out studies to optimize its flight performance by inventing simple yet effective designs for lightweight and improving lift generation and power efficiency for long endurance flights.

My research also targets a multimodal and multifunctional bio-inspired robot that in addition to flight can be equipped with more modes of transportation such as jumping, crawling, running, etc., similar to real flying animals.

## Research Interest:
- **Ion-material Simulation:** SRIM, iradina, IMSIL, CORETO, TRIDYN, MARLOWE, RustBCA
- **Machine Learning:** fairness AI, penalization and augmentation methods
- **E-field controlled magnetization** VCMA, Strain-mediated ME (Magnetoelectric) Effects, Straintronic, iontronic, E-filed induced spin reorientation, SOT.
- **Micro-, Nanofabrication**
- **Neuromorphic Computing** Neuromorphic Sensing and Perception, Hybrid Computing Systems, Brain-Inspired Robotics
